# CycleCountApp V2 — Warehouse

Brand-new Streamlit Cycle Count app with a **warehouse theme**, **mobile/scan-friendly UX**, **bilingual (EN/ES)**, **welcome splash**, **global error guards**, and placeholders for:
- Live Dashboard
- Assignments (supervisor)
- My Assignments (counter)
- Settings (sound/vibration, downloads, timezone)
- Excel column mapping for Expected QTY (to be added)
- 20-minute assignment lock and all existing rules from the current app

This repository is designed for **surgical updates**, no backups/tags, and resilient code structure to prevent runtime errors.
